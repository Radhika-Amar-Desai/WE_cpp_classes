-Don't remember sytax read the screen.
-incremental difference in syntax : to identify difference in versions
-when using cout << in cpp, each time we try to print something a new object is created which is stacked and then the stream gets printed.
-c compiler was build on unix systems.
-shell : outer layer of operating system.
-we should write main function first
-<> indicate something we have to provide
-./a.out > ct.txt = output collected in output file : output redirection
-output redirection and piping : read and write std input and output and error.
-error redirection is also possible
-cc points to gcc compiler. 
-c string and c++ string are different
-when c needs a c++ string, it wil convert c string to c++ string quietly.

-Java : claims classes are good. Python and cpp are multi paridgm languages : code is OOPs or procedural.
-Java has a virtual machine java compiler will convert java code to bytes and it will then to translated to machine specific code.
-You can only have one public class.
-Strongly typed language
-Java : you can't return 1 or 0 becoz Java will communicate to virtual machine not shell.
-Java programs coding in main function is good practice.

-cpp when integer > 0 is returned : shell is signalled of an error.
-c code : production level we need to handle exceptions.
